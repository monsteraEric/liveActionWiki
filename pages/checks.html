            <p>Physical Checks</p>
<p>Due to a new bank and company policy for fraud protection, all physical checks need to be “cleared” by accounting through our bank in order for them to be deposited by vendors/crew/etc.</p>
<p>When production knows a physical (location) check will be issued, they must send an email to billing@monstera.group with the following information</p>
<p>Check Number</p>
<p>Name of Payee</p>
<p>Date of Delivery</p>
<p>$ Total on Check</p>
<p>These requests will need to be made in advance of issuing the check to the recipient as they will need at least a day for the bank to clear the check.</p>
<p>WARNING: If these requests are not made in advance of issue, the check will bounce. Please ensure this request is made at least a day prior to the check being issued.</p>
