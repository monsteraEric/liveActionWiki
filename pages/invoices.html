            <h2>Invoices</h2>
<p>When projects are underway or wrapping, invoices will need to be submitted to accounting for payment. Note: We like to maintain net 30 terms for all invoices from companies/vendors and Net 15 terms for all freelance artists so please try and let them know of that policy before approving an estimate/quote. If the vendor does not agree, then we can discuss alternative terms for payment.</p>
<p>Due to the pandemic and constant delays from the mail systems, we want to ensure we set up everyone with ACH Direct Deposit. You will find the ACH form included here: 04_shoot⁩ ▸ ⁨07_templates_resources⁩ ▸ ⁨_resource_templates⁩ ▸ ⁨additional_templates⁩ > ACH Deposit Authorization via ACH</p>
<p>We also require a current W9 form from each vendor invoicing. Please be sure to have the vendor include a current W9 form when they send their invoice and ACH form back.</p>
<p>The process for sending invoices to accounting is simple and should speed up the process as well as ensure no invoices slip through the cracks.</p>
<p>HOW TO ORGANIZE INVOICES</p>
<p>All Invoices are treated as POs and will need to be organized via a PO Log and subsequent folders inside 04_shoot > 01_purchase_orders</p>
<p>Here, you’ll see a folder for the log. You should have already been briefed on how to use the PO Log but if not, please contact caleb.bell@lorddanger.com and we’ll set up a quick tutorial.</p>
<p>The PO backup documents are to be placed inside a PO folder titled: 001_ExampleCo, 002_Jane_Doe, etc.</p>
<p>These docs include</p>
<p>Invoice</p>
<p>W9</p>
<p>PO Top Sheet (Generated by the PO Log)</p>
<p>ACH Form (Try your best to get as many as you can).</p>
<p>Any receipt scans for a reimbursement.</p>
<p>Etc.</p>
<p>Ensure we keep the log updates as this is what Accounting uses to track and monitor invoices. Ensure the payment terms are correct as well (quickpay, net 30, net 15, etc). As long as each PO is labeled correctly with the correct due dates, accounting will ensure these get handled.</p>
<p>Accounting will then reference the associated PO folder and make sure they gather all documents needed for the payment.</p>
<p>Once the invoice has been scheduled for payment, accounting will check it off on the log to let everyone know it’s been dealt with.</p>
<p>Any POs left unchecked should be treated as unpaid and will require a follow-up to accounting. Never assume it’s been handled if it's unchecked.</p>
<p>PING ACCOUNTING WHEN INVOICES START COMING IN</p>
<p>When invoices start coming in and accounting needs to start tracking, we need to let them know.</p>
<p>Send an email to billing@monstera.group</p>
<p>Subject: “000_CLIENT_NAME // POs to Pay”</p>
<p>Body: In the body, include a quick write up letting them know invoices are starting to come in and we’d like their eyes on it to begin to track these. Include a direct link to the PO log as well a link to the purchase order</p>
