<p>It is the responsibility of the Line Producer to review and discuss the final script and shooting boards with the Agency Producer. Anything that is put in front of the camera should be considered and discussed. Do not presume that the agency or client has cleared all necessary elements. Please include the Executive Producer in all correspondence.</p>
<p>It is the Production Supervisor’s responsibility to inform the appropriate departments (location, art and wardrobe) of Lord Danger’s requirements with regards to procedures and legal clearances.</p>
<p>Please remember that any item designed and manufactured on the behalf of the production company requires legal clearance prior to usage, including items such as “fake” groceries or household items, logos on wardrobe, etc. If anyone is uncertain about a particular item, location or person, direct all inquiries to the Executive Producer for clarification.</p>
