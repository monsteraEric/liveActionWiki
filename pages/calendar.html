            <h3>Calendar</h3>
<p>Production calendars should be built on shareable scheduling software, preferably iCal or Google Calendar. Every event that takes place during production MUST go into the projectâ€™s production calendar as an active and joinable event. Every person who needs to be in attendance of the event MUST be added to the event and sent an invite.</p>
