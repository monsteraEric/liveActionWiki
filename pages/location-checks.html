            <h3>Location Checks</h3>
<p>Production Supervisorâ€™s Responsibility</p>
<p>Should a location check be needed prior to the shoot please obtain approval from the Senior Producer. Location checks, with approval from AP, can be used for quick pays. The Production Manager must maintain a log of checks they currently have, how many have been used, etc., and must send to SP on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Note that all location checks must receive proper approval from the AP prior to use. Notify the Production Manager and Production Coordinator if a check is to be cut for $5000 or more, as you will need additional approval to cut a check of this amount. Note that if you have an unsigned location check in your possession, only the Executive Producer may provide a signature.</p>
<h3>Approval of Location Checks Written on Set</h3>
<p>The Executive Producer is the only person authorized to sign checks. In an emergency situation, contact the EP.</p>
<h3>No Labor, Petty Cash, or Reimbursement to Crew</h3>
<p>Location Checks must not be used for petty cash, labor, or to reimburse a crew member. All labor must be paid via a time card with the exceptions of LLCs. Petty cash expenditures must be paid for in accordance with petty cash procedures and a Purchase Order should be issued for reimbursements together with appropriate backup receipts and a copy of the personal credit card statement, if applicable.</p>
<h3>Daily Check & Amex Logs</h3>
<p>All logs must be shared after each day of production with the Producer, Production Manager, and Production Coordinator.</p>
<p>The logs must include the check number, date check was written, payee, PO number, line number(s) and amount to be allocated to each line number.</p>
<h3>Unused Location & Voided Checks</h3>
<p>Return unused or voided location checks to accounting as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Obtain W-9 From Vendors</h3>
<p>The vendor must have completed a W-9 prior to issuing a location check.</p>
<p>PAYEE NAME MUST MATCH W-9 All checks should be written to the same name as on the W-9. For example, if the W-9 is for a company and an FEI # is given, then the check must be written to the company. Checks can only be made out to individuals if the W-9 contains the individual's social security number. Production must obtain a W9 from any vendors or crew being paid over $599.00 prior to payment.</p>
