<h3>Animals</h3>
<p>Even though Lord Danger is not a SAG signatory, it is the production’s responsibility to notify the AHA when using animals on set, whether domestic or international.</p>

<h3>Agreement/Contract</h3>
<p>Before production begins, please obtain an official, signed agreement/contract from the animal trainer/company. Do not work off of an estimate. If changes are made during production, remember to get a revised agreement/contract. Lord Danger will not pay off an estimate.</p>
<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<p>Refer to The American Humane Association's guidelines regarding comprehensive guidelines, procedures, individual animals, and situational information. Below is a brief explanation taken from these guidelines:</p>
<p>SAG/AFTRA</p>
<p>Domestic: As of January 1, 2014, The American Humane Association has agreed on terms of fee-for-service to be charged on all domestic SAG productions filmed in the United States. The following charges apply:</p>
<p>2 weeks registration notice requested whenever possible</p>
<p>$500 per day Certified Animal Safety Rep</p>
<p>Mileage reimbursement</p>
<p>Travel time $35 per hour cap of 8 hours</p>
<p>Idle days at an overnight location are $280</p>
<p>If the AHA monitors the animal action on a SAG/AFTRA domestic production and if, after screening the spot, it is determined that the production is eligible for a sign-off letter, AHA issues an official letter.</p>
<p>If the AHA is unable to monitor a SAG/domestic production, that production may be eligible for a “Not Monitored: Production Compliant” letter and/or rating, as long as the production has remained compliant throughout the entire process, from registering to submitting a screening.</p>
<p>If the production is not monitored, follow through with the Agency Producer and confirm a cut or link of the spot will be sent to the American Humane for viewing – it is the agency’s responsibility to provide this to AHA.</p>
<p>Non-SAG/AFTRA and International Shoots (Including SAG/AFTRA)</p>
<p>2 weeks registration notice requested whenever possible</p>
<p>$1200 per day (one rep)</p>
<p>$600 per half day (6 hours or fewer)</p>
<p>Mileage reimbursement</p>
<p>Travel expenses are the production company's responsibility</p>
<p>Travel time $35 per hour cap of 8 hours</p>
<p>International Protocal</p>
<p>American Humane Association's International Program is designed for foreign productions as well as US productions filmed overseas. Foreign productions are covered by an American Humane Association Certified Animal Safety Representative or by an AHA-approved Partner Field Safety Representative. (Cost and details as pointed out above – please call and check availability.)</p>
<p>If a local representative is not available, production may be responsible for traveling one from the U.S. Currently, American Humane Association has Certified Animal Safety Representatives in the UK, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada.</p>
<p>Regardless of the production, the American Humane Association Production Information Form must be completed. Make sure to include all required paperwork. Keep all AHA paperwork together, including email correspondence, in the Talent section of the Wrap folder. Please remember to forward a copy of both the form and the “no animals harmed” letter to the Agency Producer.</p>
<p>Special Requirements for Extras/Others who Supply Animals</p>
<p>Although these special requirements apply to extras or other private owners (including cast and crew members), production is ultimately responsible for the wellbeing of any animal on a set. Lord Danger discourages bringing personal pets to set.</p>
<p>If an animal is being used that is not supplied by a USDA certified animal supplier (Ex: An animal belonging to cast or crew), the animal owner must obtain a USDA Exhibitor’s License Waiver (for one-time use of animal) prior to using the animal. Please note that this process can take up to 10 days.</p>
<p>Remember that a client-approved copy of the spot(s) must be submitted to the American Humane Association's post-production department in order for the Agency to receive the official sign-off letter.</p>
