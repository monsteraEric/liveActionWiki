            <h3>Check Requests</h3>
<p>A Check Request is to be used for COD charges only. Examples of COD charges follow:</p>
<p>Locations</p>
<p>Stage Deposits</p>
<p>Security Deposits and Rentals</p>
<p>Any non-account vendors.</p>
<p>Note that with prior approval from OC, you may use a location check for COD charges.</p>
<h3>Submitting Check Requests</h3>
<p>Make clear that this is not for quick pays, net payments.</p>
<p>Scan and email your check requests (PO, backup, W-9, etc.), and please cc the PM. Checks will then be ready for pick up at OLC by around 12 pm the next day. You will need to confirm exact pickup times with OLC.</p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>After the last day of shooting, check requests will not be accepted or processed unless prior arrangements have been made with the AP.</p>
