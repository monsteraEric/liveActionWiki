            <p>A signed overage form will be required to spend additional monies beyond the original bid. Attach the backup to the overage with wrap. Additional cost approval forms must be discussed and approved with the Producer and EP prior to spending.</p>
<h3>Overages</h3>
<p>An overage form is required for all overages. Be sure to include mark-up and insurance on overages, where they apply (check with Executive Producer). The overage form must be signed by the Agency Producer and Line Producer before additional monies can be spent.</p>
<p>If the Agency Producer agrees to the overage but refuses to sign, do not go forward with the expenditures until the Executive Producer gives the authorization to do so. At wrap, include a copy of all pending and approved overages in the wrap book, and include a copy of the overages in folder number</p>
<p>Note that all overages must be signed in order to actualize them in the Producer‘s Actual. Also, attach copies of all overages with the Producer‘s actual when emailing the Producer‘s actual to the Managing Director and Executive Producer.</p>
<p>*Please outline all signed overages within the wrap notes.</p>
<p>An overage form template is found on the Freelance Wiredrive, within the “Forms” folder.</p>
<h3>Overage Backup</h3>
<p>Backups are required for all overages</p>
<h3>Overages at Wrap</h3>
<p>Confirm copies of all overages (with backup when applicable) are in the Wrap Binder. The backup is crucial for getting the overages paid. If receipts come from Petty Cash, be sure that all receipts are un-folded before copying, and verify their legibility. If there are any problems gathering this information, please let the Executive Producer know before turning in the wrap. The original signed overage stays in the Wrap Book.</p>
