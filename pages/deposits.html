            <h3>Security Deposits and Rentals</h3>
<p>Security Deposits and rentals must be listed separately on the PO. Indicate Security Deposit on PO and a separate line for the refund as a negative. Let the EP know if the check will be held or deposited.</p>
<p>Any additional charges being taken out of the deposit should be indicated on the PO.</p>
<p>If the deposit check is to be returned, do not fill out a new PO. If the check is returned before wrap, give the check to the AP. Do not put the check in the wrap binder. If the check will be mailed after wrap, have the vendor send the check back "Attn. Accounting".</p>
<p>Production must notify AP of the status of any security deposits i.e. if they are to be cashed and then reissued or held onto and returned etc.</p>
<h3>Deposits for Stage and Constructions</h3>
<p>Indicate on the PO when the deposit is a down payment towards the total rental, as opposed to a refundable security deposit. The amount should be lined out to a stage line. If after turning in the PO, the line #s change, send an email to the EP â€“ the email should include the PO #, the old line #, and the new line #s and amounts.</p>
