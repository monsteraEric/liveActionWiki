            <h3>COIS</h3>
<p>Issuing COIs with our company insurance vendor is simple. See below for steps on how to generate a COI.</p>
<p>Credentials:</p>
<p>Website: https://my.mfeinsurance.com</p>
<p>Username: lorddanger</p>
<p>PW: Mikeharris420</p>
<p>Steps</p>
<p>Login to the MFE Insurance Portal with the credentials listed above.</p>
<p>Top left of the screen, click on the purple/blue button labeled “Issue Certificate”</p>
<p>Include the necessary information in the fields provided.</p>
<p>When all info has been entered, click “Submit.”</p>
<p>Download the certificate off the site. Be sure to file it away here: 04_shoot⁩ ▸ ⁨07_insurance⁩ ▸ cois</p>
<h3>SPECIAL LANGUAGE</h3>
<p>If a vendor requires any special language on the COI, it needs to be generated by our insurance rep. If this is needed, please send an email to marta@mfeinsurance.com requesting this COI. Be sure to include all relevant information for them to generate the COI correctly.</p>
<p>MFE Insurance Contact:</p>
<p>Email: marta@mfeinsurance.com</p>
<p>Website: https://clients.mfeinsurance.com/client</p>
<p>All claims must be submitted to MFE Insurance within 24 hours of the accident or incident, so proper paper and approvals are critical. If assistance is needed, please see the Executive Producer.</p>
<p>Please notify Media Services immediately if filming in North Dakota, Ohio, Washington, or Wyoming. These states are monopolistic states and administer the claims themselves rather than through a private carrier. Advance notice is necessary if a Certificate of Insurance is needed.</p>
<h3>Insurance Certificates</h3>
<p>Type the vendor‘s information in the appropriate portion of the certificate. Include the job name and number with the vendor information.</p>
<p>Example: Marshall Surfboards 1234 Santa Monica Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90024 FOR: Job # 3333 "Mountain Dew"</p>
<p>Filing Insurance Certificates:</p>
<p>• 1 copy to vendor</p>
<p>• 1 copy in wrap binder</p>
<p>• 1 copy uploaded to the insurance folder in your project file on the drive, as well as PO folder</p>
<p>Once the Insurance Certificates have been received by the agency, please follow the Lord Danger insurance procedures above.</p>
<h3>Worker’s Compensation</h3>
<p>Regardless of which party is covering insurance – Lord Danger or Agency – Workers' Compensation for Crew is covered by Media Services. Absolutely ALL workers comp claims must be filed with Media Services. Please let the EP know if you have any questions about this.</p>
<h3>Stunts</h3>
<p>Lord Danger’s coverage is automatically in place. There is no need to contact Media Services unless directed by the Executive Producer or the stunts change in the degree of difficulty.</p>
<h3>Special Insurance</h3>
<p>Please remember to email contact@mfeinsurance.com if you need to request anything different or specific on your COI.</p>
<p>Please notify the EP, Insurance Carrier, and Worker’s Compensation Agent if shooting in high-risk locations. The 1st AD must conduct a thorough safety meeting before work commences and obtain all crew and cast signatures. Proper ventilation must be established before entering the location.</p>
