            <h3>Special Endorsements and Waivers of Subrogation</h3>
<p>If a vendor requests a Certificate of Insurance with any special endorsements and/or a Waiver of Subrogation, inform the Executive Producer immediately. Please note that additional costs may be incurred. With that said, it is standard practice to provide a Waiver of Subrogation when filming at Universal Studios. Please allow one day to process paperwork.</p>
<p>If the request concerns General Liability, Auto, Umbrella or Production Insurance please consult the Executive Producer before contacting MFE Insurance. Please back up all communication with emails and remember to include the Executive Producer in all correspondence.</p>
<p>If the request concerns the Workerâ€™s Compensation policy, again please consult the Executive Producer before contacting MFE Insurance. Please backup all communication with emails and remember to include the Executive Producer in all correspondence.</p>
