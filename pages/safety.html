            <h3>Safety</h3>
<p>Public notification is required when filming at locations that remain open to the public during filming. Please coordinate with the 2nd AD and Location Manager to ensure that proper and sufficient signs are posted inside and outside the facility. Confirm that all cables and equipment are properly flagged or covered by the appropriate departments.</p>
<h3>Fire Requirements</h3>
<p>The Office of the State Fire Marshal oversees fire, special effects, and life safety issues on state property. Fire safety officers or advisors assigned from a local jurisdiction may be required under provisions set by the Fire Marshal review. Special effects, indoor filming, large crews, projectile pyrotechnics, and filming during fire season or in fire-sensitive areas are examples of activities that may warrant fire safety officer (FSO) or advisor (FSA) assignment. Monitor fees are determined by and billed through the local jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Production must follow up on Fire Marshall hours or additional charges with the State Fire Marshall and acquire their invoice at the end of the shoot day.</p>
