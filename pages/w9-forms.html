<p>Unless confirmation is received from accounting that a W-9 from a specific vendor is on file, obtain a fully completed and signed W-9 prior to submitting the check request or PO. *** A W9 MUST be collected if we are paying anybody over $600.00 *** No one should be paid unless we receive their W9.</p>
<p>All POs must have a corresponding W9 on file. All vendors are required by law to provide their Federal ID# when requesting payment for rentals.</p>
<p>All W-9’s must be current, within the 12-month calendar year that your job took place.</p>
<p>All W-9‘s must be on file at the end of the job or the vendors will not be paid.</p>
<p>The wrap is not complete until all W-9‘s are on file.</p>
<p>Location Checks will not be released without signed, dated, and filed W-9 Forms</p>
