            <p>Please note that along with time cards all crew must submit a signed Crew Deal Memo</p>
<p>*See Deal Memo Section*</p>
<h3>Timecard Basics</h3>
<p>Submit all time cards to Media Services via the Payroll Coordinator.</p>
<p>Please contact Operations Manager to obtain blank time cards. Additional time card paperwork such as I9’s and Wage theft forms can be found on the project drive in the payroll folder.</p>
<p>Payroll Contact:</p>
<p>Michael Wilson, Payroll Coordinator</p>
<p>Email: MichaelW@media-services.com</p>
<p>When submitting timecards, make sure that the following information is included in the documentation:</p>
<p>Production Company Name, Job Name, Job Number</p>
<p>Union and Occupation Description</p>
<p>Employee Name and SS# (required for loan-out employees as well)</p>
<p>Employee address</p>
<p>Loan-out Name and Federal ID if applicable</p>
<p>Check off indication Male/Female</p>
<p>Hourly Rate in Rate field (ensuring it is same for all days per timecard)</p>
<p>Work Dates</p>
<p>All work and meal in-and-out times</p>
<p>Employee and production signatures</p>
<p>Completed Start / Close Form on the back of each timecard</p>
<p>Completed W-4, I-9 & Wage Theft Protection Act Form</p>
<p>Wage Theft Protection Act Form must be prefilled with hourly rates</p>
<h3>No Altered Timecards</h3>
<p>Altering timecards in any way - including in-and-out times without the initialed approval of the employee is unacceptable and timecards will be returned. Please Email or fax a timecard that needs to be changed to the employee and have them make all changes, or call the employee to verify that alterations to the timecard are approved prior to making changes.</p>
<h3>Minimum Hourly Wage</h3>
<p>Be certain that employees are paid at least minimum wage (for both union and non-union) for their appropriate occupation, especially if a daily guarantee is used. The word "flat" must not appear anywhere on the timecard. Lord Danger does not pay "premium overtime." For example, if a crew member works on a 10-hour guarantee, then overtime is based on dividing the guarantee by 11, not 10. If on a 12-hour guarantee, then overtime is based on dividing the guarantee by 14, not 12. Also, Media Services Universal will not pay a timecard with multiple rates. Have the employee fill out multiple timecards or average the rates so that the gross and hours match.</p>
<h3>Union Timecards</h3>
<p>Crew members working union occupations must complete the "Union Box" on the timecard with their correct union local number, regardless of their union affiliation unless it is an Internet production or a Television, Film, or Tape production. Lord Danger is a signatory to the multi-state agreement and is legally obligated to pay union benefits.</p>
<h3>Crew Rates</h3>
<p>Crew rates should not exceed the budgeted amounts. If other rates are requested, please discuss with the Production Manager. Without the approval of the PM, Lord Danger will not pay crew rates above those provided for in the budget.</p>
<h3>Non-Union Crew & Talent</h3>
<p>All must complete a Wage Theft Prevention Act Form. These can be found in the “Contracts and Releases” folder in the Payroll Folder on Google Drive.</p>
<h3>IRS Tax Forms</h3>
<p>I-9‘s & W-4‘s must be filled out at the beginning of each new job. The W-4 and I-9s can be found on the back of and attached to the timecards. Indicating that an I-9 or W-4 is "on file" will only be accepted and processed after having been properly completed at the end of each job.</p>
<h3>One Week per Timecard</h3>
<p>A workweek runs from Sunday to Saturday. If an employee works only a couple of days one week and a couple of days the next week, then he/she should fill out two timecards.</p>
<h3>Mileage or Kit/Box Rentals</h3>
<p>Enter this information in the appropriate section of the timecard including a line number. Do not include these amounts in the gross pay box. Attach a copy of the mileage or kit/box rental form along with the timecard in order to receive payment.</p>
<h3>Meals</h3>
<p>Meals must be reflected on the timecard. Under California Law, all non-exempt employees are entitled to a meal break every 6 hours. A meal penalty for a non-union employee is equal to one-hour base pay per day. There are no multiple meal penalties for non-union employees. Direct any questions regarding meal penalties for union or non-union employees to the PM.</p>
<h3>No Cash Labor Payments</h3>
<p>We do not pay cash for labor. All payments for labor are to be made through our payroll service, or invoice.</p>
<p>If an employee wants to be paid as a Loan Out by Media Services each loan out timecard must also provide the following documents to confirm payment through Media Services, or invoice.</p>
<p>• Filled out timecard with loan-out name & number, or invoice</p>
<p>• Current W9</p>
<p>• I9</p>
