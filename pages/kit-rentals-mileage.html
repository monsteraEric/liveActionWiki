            <h3>Kit Rentals & Mileage</h3>
<p>Kit rentals and mileage are paid on timecards only. It is necessary to complete the kit rental form and/or a mileage form and attach it to the timecard in order to receive payment for kit rental and/or mileage.</p>
<p>We do not pay kit rental for computers, printers, copiers, or scanners. We do not pay crew for vehicle rental; we pay the applicable IRS mileage reimbursement rate. Kit rentals should have a detailed inventory with an overall value of the kit included with the kit form.</p>
