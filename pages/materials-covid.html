            <p>Lord Danger has a COVID compliance document included in each project directory: 04_shoot⁩ ▸ ⁨07_templates_resources⁩ ▸ ⁨_covid_materials⁩</p>
<p>Please be sure to read this document and ensure your production follows these protocols! You may also share it with your crew when sending out call sheets.</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<p>Beginning in August of 2021, all on-set personnel must verify they are fully vaccinated at least 2 weeks prior to being on set. All must provide, either digitally or physically, their vaccination card to the Covid Compliance Officer before entering the set.</p>
<p>Per the CDC, “fully vaccinated” means receiving both (2) doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines or (1) single dose of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.</p>
<p>Per the CDC, it takes 2 weeks for a fully vaccinated person to build immunity to COVID-19.</p>
