            <h3>General Location Agreement Procedures</h3>
<p>The Executive Producer will review all location contracts prior to the producer signing all contracts. Lord Danger agreements must be signed by the location owner/agent prior to EP review and producer signature.</p>
<p>All locations must have a signed property release prior to shooting. Use Lord Danger agreement contracts/ forms whenever possible. If the location insists on using its own forms or desires to change Lord Danger forms, obtain approval from the EP. Any questions regarding what release is to be used for a given location should be directed to the EP. Keep ALL original signed copies of the releases for the wrap binder.</p>
<p>Location Agreements must be signed by the owner of the property or an agent authorized to sign on behalf of the owner. Typically, tenants or renters are not authorized. They must provide a copy of their contract with the landlord stating they have the required authority. Otherwise, the landlord must be contacted to get approval. Likewise, co-op owners do not have control over their apartment buildings and agreements will likely need to be signed by the Co-Op Board.</p>
<p>At the end of the shoot, the PM must conduct a walk-through with the site rep and complete the Location Departure Release Form, which can be found in the Locations folder on Google Drive.</p>
<h3>Conduct</h3>
<p>When on location, the entire crew represents Lord Danger. Everyone is expected to be respectful of the property rules and of the surroundings. The crew must be notified of conduct expectations at every location. Direct all complaints or correspondence to the Production Manager.</p>
<p>Please remove all location and directional signs from the location at wrap. Discuss with the Location Manager and plan accordingly.</p>
