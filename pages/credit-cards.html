            <h3>Credit Cards</h3>
<h3>Lord Danger Corporate American Express</h3>
<p>The Executive Producer’s corporate AMEX is to be used for most purchases i.e. airline tickets, hotels, car service, vehicle rentals, Lord Danger preferred vendors, vendors who do not provide payment terms, etc. All POs are to be submitted to OLC as charges are approved by the EP. It may also be used for production and is actually preferred to cash as cash gets lost and is untraceable.</p>
<p>Please see “Purchase Orders” for proper procedures on paperwork.</p>
<p>Setting up a Credit Card Authorization Form: Credit card authorization forms will not be approved without a PO – please present both forms to the EP to obtain approval of Amex use.</p>
<p>All travel costs are to go on the EP’s Lord Danger AMEX. All points are to go to Lord Danger, no exceptions.</p>
<p>Find a copy of the company AMEX Credit Card and driver’s license in your project directory under 04_shoot⁩ ▸ ⁨05_departments⁩ ▸ ⁨_producers⁩ ▸ ⁨03_Financials⁩ ▸ ⁨01_company_amex⁩</p>
<p>There may be cases where vendors will need a CC authorization form filled out to run the order. Please use this card pending approval from the Head of Production to charge the card.</p>
