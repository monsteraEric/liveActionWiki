            <h3>Petty Cash Receipts</h3>
<p>List PC receipts on the envelope individually. Do not group them and list them as one amount. Receipts must be on the vendor‘s printed stationery or cash register tape and the vendor‘s name should appear clearly on the receipt. Altered receipts will be rejected.</p>
<p>Any reference books, videos, hard drives, memory cards, etc., that are purchased with PC belong to Lord Danger and must be turned in with the PC envelopes. If the Director, agency, or client wishes to keep said items, please notify the EP before reconciliation.</p>
