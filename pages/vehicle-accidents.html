            <h3>Vehicle Accidents</h3>
<p>For any vehicle accidents that take place (i.e. a rented vehicle insured by Lord Danger or agency insurance, AND in which a driver is employed by Lord Danger under payroll), A POLICE REPORT MUST BE OBTAINED. This applies to ANY accident, no matter how large or small. It is the production’s responsibility to inform all personnel driving under Lord Danger’s employ that this is the procedure.</p>
<p>Fill out the Vehicle Accident Report completely, including the diagram on Page 3. Fill out the forms in detail, including the following:</p>
<p>Explanation of the accident</p>
<p>Description of injuries to any party</p>
<p>Names and phone numbers of any witnesses</p>
<p>The extent of damage to all vehicles (or other property) involved</p>
<p>Photographs of damaged property</p>
<p>Request a copy of the Police Report</p>
<p>The name, address, phone number, license number, and insurance carrier of all people and companies involved in the accident;</p>
<p>If the vehicle was rented, the name of the rental company and a copy of the rental agreement indicating the insurance coverage was purchased. The production insurance will not cover personal vehicles, only rented vehicles and third-party claimants.</p>
<p>Email the completed form to the EP. File a copy of the filed claim in the Wrap Book.</p>
