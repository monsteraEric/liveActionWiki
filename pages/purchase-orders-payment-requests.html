            <h3>Purchase Orders & Payment Requests</h3>
<p>Purchase Orders (“POs”) are required for every cost incurred on a production, including AMEX charges and location checks.</p>
<h3>Purchase Order Tutorial</h3>
<p>Fill out all of the information on the PO completely on Zoho. Provide the following information:</p>
<p>• Job name and number</p>
<p>• Name of vendor & contact</p>
<p>• Vendors full address</p>
<p>• Price/Cost</p>
<p>• Line number</p>
<p>List an amount on a PO when seeking credit card authorization signatures from the EP. There is an estimate column on the POs that should be filled out with this information before seeking the EP’s signature.</p>
<p>• All POs must be signed by either the Producer or Head of Production.</p>
<p>• Multiple invoices for the same vendor may go on one PO (do not combine multiple vendors on one PO)</p>
<p>• Each invoice should be listed separately on the PO and PO Log</p>
<p>Indicate on your PO if Lord Danger is owed any money (for credits, returns, etc.) or if there was loss or damage. Please provide a detailed description of the reasons for money owed or any damage/loss.</p>
<p>Credit Card purchases must be made out to the vendor and not to the credit card, i.e. Amex. The last 4 digits of the card number must be indicated on the PO next to the checked box labeled "Credit Card".</p>
<h3>Copies of POs</h3>
<p>All PO’s must be digitized in the drive into its own folder following this format:</p>
<p>PO # - Job Number - Vendor</p>
<p>001-#300 Galpin</p>
<p>002-#300 J.L. Fisher</p>
<p>Each folder should include the PO, any vendor paperwork, agreements, COI’s, cc auths, invoices, and W9’s or receipts.</p>
