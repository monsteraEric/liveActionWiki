            <h3>Talent</h3>
<p>All talent must sign a release. The agency must provide all talent contracts. If it’s a non-union situation or talent buyout and Lord Danger is providing the release, please confirm which release is to be used with the EP.</p>
<p>All talent must sign a formal Lord Danger talent agreement that can be found in the Template Agreements folder along with any contracts from the client or agency.</p>
<p>Lord Danger’s policy is to only buyout fees once final cuts are locked and confirmed and once airing terms begin for media. It should be noted within the Lord Danger Talent Contracts that buyout fees will only be paid once appearance of talent is confirmed in the final cut, and once the airing term begins. Please see the EP about any clarification needed for the Lord Danger talent contract and if any changes are needed.</p>
<p>If the agency is responsible for paying talent, the Line Producer should still spot-check the agency contract to ensure that session and buyout fees are being paid separately (not as one lump sum). This could help the agency save some green if they hadn’t thought of that already (because if that talent doesn’t appear in the spot, then they just get the session fee). If you’re not digging on this (i.e. not wrapping your head around it), it’s EP time. Go knock on the door of the EP’s office and pretend to cry and he’ll give you sage guidance.</p>
<p>Production is legally responsible for notifying people or crowds when they are coming into contact with filming. Please post multiple copies of the Crowd Notification sheet around the set, in accessible areas for all to see and if necessary have a production assistant inform the people/crowd verbally.</p>
