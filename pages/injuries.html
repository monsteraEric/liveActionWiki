            <h3>INJURIES - SEEKING EMERGENCY MEDICAL ATTENTION</h3>
<p>In case of an emergency, go to the nearest hospital or urgent care center. Most do not require prior authorization. The following completed forms must accompany the injured worker, emergency or not. If injury is serious, send along an appropriate Lord Danger representative with a call sheet and:</p>
<p>Chartis/Media Services Authorization to Use and Disclose Health Information and Communication Release</p>
<p>Injury Notification East/West - depends on location, see form for specifics</p>
<p>Chartis/Tmesys First Fill form (medication)</p>
<p>Lord Danger is obligated by law to offer medical attention. The injured worker has the right to refuse/decline medical care. If a worker refuses medical care, Lord Danger and Media Services Universal require a signed Right of Refusal form to be filled out immediately. Do not let the worker return to set without completing the form.</p>
<p>This form must be submitted along with an Accident Investigation Report, regardless of the severity of the incident, event, or accident. If the worker has refused medical attention but the Line Producer, 1st AD or Production Supervisor believe medical attention is necessary, please do not send the worker back to set and contact the Executive Producer or Executive Producer immediately, as they may wish to enforce medical attention.</p>
<h3>WORKER’S COMPENSATION</h3>
<p>The following paperwork must be completed when an accident/injury occurs:</p>
<p>First Report of Injury – completed and signed by the 1st AD, Line Producer, or Production Manager (whoever is most knowledgeable regarding the accident/injury)</p>
<p>Copy of employee’s timecard – up to and including the day of injury</p>
<p>California Residents/Non-Residents Injured in California – Employee’s Claim for Worker’s Compensation (DWC1)</p>
<p>Right of Refusal – if the employee refuses medical attention</p>
<p>Accident Investigation Report – describing circumstances surrounding the injury, with motion or still pictures if available</p>
<p>Authorization for access - a signed copy of Authorization to Use and Disclose Health Information and Communications Release</p>
<p>This form is in addition to the First Report of Injury.</p>
<p>Remember to fill out all necessary forms, a letter of explanation, and print out all email correspondence. Please submit all paperwork to the Executive Producer for review and submission and remember to include it in the Wrap folder.</p>
<p>The insurance carrier will assign an insurance adjuster and claim number once Media Services has received all the complete, necessary paperwork.</p>
<p>These forms can be found within the freelance forms provided to you at the start of the job as well as the Media Services Website:</p>
