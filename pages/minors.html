            <h3>Minors</h3>
<p>A minor is a performer under the age of 18. A parent or guardian must accompany any performer under the age of 18 at all times unless the performer is emancipated (and has documented proof of such status).</p>
<p>In most cases, union/guild labor laws trump state labor laws. This is especially so with regards to minor talent. With that said, the guild complies with child labor laws that are more restrictive. California has the most restrictive child labor laws, therefore should be used as a guide when shooting out of state. Below is a quick reference to some basic regulations.</p>
<p>A copy of the minorâ€™s work permit and Coogan Account must accompany the talent contract.</p>
<p>Studio Teachers & Welfare Workers</p>
<p>Employers shall provide a studio teacher:</p>
<p>On each call for minors from age 15 days to their 15 years</p>
<p>Minors from age 16 to 18 years when required for the education of the minor</p>
<p>One studio teacher must be provided for each group of 10 minors or a fraction thereof</p>
<p>With respect to minors aged 15 days to 16 years, one studio teacher must be provided for each group of 20 minors or a fraction thereof on Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, or during school vacation periods.</p>
<p>California employers that are bound by contractual arrangements made in California to employ minors residing within the state to work on locations outside of the state must comply with all California regulations, including the use of studio teachers.</p>
