            <h3>Casting Documentation Procedures</h3>
<p>The Casting Director should inform production immediately of any needs for a Taft Hartley before booking non-SAG talent on a SAG project. Production must inform the Agency immediately. Agency Producer must also be notified via email when and talent incurs penalties.</p>
<p>(i.e. third callback, wardrobe session OT, meal penalties, and OT on set.)</p>
<p>Copies and scans of all signed talent contracts with 2 pictures (head & shoulders and full body) should be maintained for the wrap and originals sent to the agency.</p>
<p>Station 12s are to be completed with copies in the talent wrap section for all principal talent (if it is a SAG shoot).</p>
<p>If children or babies are being cast, please refer to the SAG & Labor law rules in the talent section of this manual.</p>
