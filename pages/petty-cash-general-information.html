            <h3>Petty Cash</h3>
<p>The Production Manager and/or Assistant PM/Operations Manager are responsible for each production‘s adherence to these petty cash procedures and for submitting the petty cash log upon completion of the project.</p>
<h3>Obtaining Petty Cash</h3>
<p>One purchase order made out to Petty Cash is to be used for each production. Petty Cash requests for a maximum of $5,000. Please note we will request a breakdown of PC allocation if more than 2 requests are made on any one project.</p>
<p>The Petty Cash requests must include the Production Manager’s name with the amount being requested clearly stated on the PO and the denominations of the currency. PC will be delivered the next day to the Production Manager.</p>
<p>These requests should be emailed to our accountant listed at the beginning of this manual.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if we need to send a PA to the bank, please make the check out to Petty Cash with the person’s name picking it up. This will be the only person allowed by the bank to pick up cash. If there is a change, notify the AP immediately. Accounting must also obtain a copy of the driver’s license of the person who will be going to the bank to pick up the cash.</p>
<h3>Dispensing Petty Cash</h3>
<p>One person (the Production Manager or Operations Manager) is responsible for dispensing petty cash to the crew. This person will be held accountable for all petty cash until the conclusion of the job. All cash outlays to crew members must be signed for individually, and accounted for by that employee. Before handing off any petty cash the AP will give you a petty cash agreement form that must be filled out along with extra copies for the production manager to disperse as cash is dispersed. All cash must be logged and allocated correctly. AP will provide you with a petty cash expense form to fill out, if the producer has their own sheets that work as well this is fine, however, please confirm with AP.</p>
