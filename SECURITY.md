# Security Notice

## ⚠️ Password Protection is NOT Secure

The password gate implemented on this site is **client-side only** and **does NOT provide real security**.

### Why This Isn't Secure

1. **Viewable Source**: Anyone can view the page source code
2. **JavaScript is Public**: All client-side code can be seen by anyone
3. **No Server Validation**: There's no backend to verify passwords
4. **GitHub Pages is Static**: Only serves static files - no server-side processing

### Current Implementation

- Password is stored in `password-config.js` (obfuscated)
- Uses `sessionStorage` for authentication state
- Client-side JavaScript validates the password

### What This Actually Does

- ✅ **Casual Protection**: Keeps non-technical users out
- ✅ **UX Gate**: Provides a simple access control interface
- ❌ **NOT Secure**: Can be bypassed by anyone viewing source
- ❌ **NOT Production-Ready**: For internal/internal use only

### For Real Security

If you need actual security, consider:

1. **Use a Backend**: Deploy on a server with server-side authentication
2. **Cloudflare Access**: Add authentication proxy in front of the site
3. **GitHub Private Repo**: Make the entire repository private (but still viewable)
4. **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict access at the network level
5. **VPN Required**: Require VPN connection to access
6. **Netlify/AWS CloudFront**: Use password protection features

### Changing the Password

Edit `password-config.js` and commit the change.
