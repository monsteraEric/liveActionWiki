# Cloudflare Access Setup

Cloudflare Access can add true password protection to your GitHub Pages site.

## Setup Steps

1. **Move Domain to Cloudflare** (if not already)
   - Add your domain to Cloudflare
   - Update nameservers to point to Cloudflare

2. **Add Access Policy**
   - Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → Access → Applications
   - Create new application
   - Point to your GitHub Pages URL
   - Set up email-based authentication or password

3. **Result**
   - ✅ True server-side authentication
   - ✅ Password actually protected
   - ✅ Works with GitHub Pages
   - ✅ Free for basic use

## Alternative: Netlify

If you want to stay completely independent:

1. Deploy to Netlify instead of GitHub Pages
2. Enable password protection in Netlify settings
3. Set a site-wide password
4. ✅ True password protection
5. ✅ Still free

Would you like me to prepare your site for Netlify deployment?
